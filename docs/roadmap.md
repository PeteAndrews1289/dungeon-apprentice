# Roadmap

## Foundation

- [x] Deterministic procedural generator for Tiers 0–2
- [x] Pixels-only policy observation wrapper
- [x] Full-state solvability oracle kept outside learning
- [x] Seed-partitioned validation and final suites
- [x] Recurrent PPO training and atomic checkpoint publication
- [x] Automatic promotion and retention testing
- [x] Living local dashboard and append-only evaluation history
- [x] Short v0 engineering canary on Tier 0
- [x] Independent reward, scheduling, resume, and hardware audit
- [x] Complete local v0.1 train-save-reload-resume-evaluate qualification
- [x] Pass the published v0.1 training smoke in GitHub Actions
- [x] Establish Navigate learnability across multiple random seeds
- [ ] Implement and qualify the proposed v0.2 Unlock staircase
- [ ] Demonstrate full Unlock with retained Navigate across multiple random seeds

The first end-to-end 64-step smoke run completed on July 22, 2026. It exercised initialization,
experience collection, checkpoint publication, held-out evaluation, status history, frame capture,
model reload, and clean shutdown. It is an engineering test, not a learning result. A later audit
invalidated all v0 runs as capability evidence because curiosity could reward failure and scheduled
exams measured pre-update policies. Protocol v0.1 fixes both before any long experiment.

The local v0.1 qualification also covers strict digest/config resume, distinct child RNG streams,
discounted reward dominance, terminal timeout semantics, interrupted-child recovery, bounded storage,
and milestone-rich evaluations. Three subsequent fresh canaries established Navigate learnability
and exposed the next two gates: transition-balanced retention and full Unlock discovery.

## Scalability gates

The project scales in two different senses, and both require evidence:

1. **Experimental scale:** bounded storage, disk guards, atomic digest-linked artifact files, strict
   resume validation, unattended shutdown, and reproducible multiple-seed comparisons.
2. **Mechanical scale:** declarative mechanics/tasks, a capability graph, isolated and composed
   suites, and objective disambiguation before adding multiple possible quests.

Do not add gameplay breadth merely because one overnight process stays alive. The three v0.1
canaries established repeatable Navigate learning but exposed both a full-Unlock discovery cliff and
post-promotion forgetting. The proposed [v0.2 design](protocol-v0.2-design.md) therefore adds a
declarative lesson layer, progressively harder complete Unlock quests, and transition-balanced
retention recovery before Retrieve is attempted. Only after full Unlock is learned and Navigate is
retained should the project add the third capability or a new mechanic.

## Capability releases

| Release | Mechanics | Final question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V0 | Navigation, one key/door, one relic, return | Can one policy learn and retain the basic quest? |
| V1 | Multiple colors, decoy keys, inventory choice | Does it learn matching rather than “pick up anything”? |
| V2 | Levers, remote state changes, one-way passages | Can it remember consequences outside its view? |
| V3 | Traps, health, limited-use tools | Can it trade risk against progress? |
| V4 | Moving enemies and safe zones | Can it plan under a changing world? |
| V5 | Multiple floors and composed objectives | Can learned skills become a complete unseen adventure? |

Every release retains all previous frozen suites. New mechanics are not added to an active declared
run, and a successor is compared with both its immediate predecessor and a fresh-start control.
